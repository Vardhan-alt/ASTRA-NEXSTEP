# NEXSTEP
### Autonomous AI Career Development System

> Career development as a closed-loop decision process, not static advice.

---

## Overview

NEXSTEP is a multi-agent AI system that treats career planning as **sequential decision-making under uncertainty**. Instead of providing one-time recommendations, it continuously reasons about career state, executes actions, learns from outcomes, and adapts strategy.

**Core Loop:**
```<img width="1818" height="262" alt="Untitled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca5b9ba1-5779-4ee2-b8aa-62e0409e1399" />
```

---

## Problem Statement

Existing career platforms fail because they:
- Provide static advice that doesn't adapt
- Ignore rejection signals and failures
- Assume fixed career paths
- Lack measurable progress indicators

Students invest time without understanding *why* they fail or *what* to change.

---

## Solution

NEXSTEP models careers as evolving state systems where:
- **Rejections** = learning signals, not dead ends
- **Progress** = quantified via Career Momentum Score
- **Paths** = simulated before commitment
- **Strategy** = continuously updated from outcomes

---

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Design

Seven specialized agents coordinated by an orchestrator:

**1. Profile Agent**
- Parses resumes (PDF/DOCX)
- Maintains skill inventory and competency scores
- Powers the "Profile Overview" section
- Updates Career Momentum Score in real-time

**2. Market Intelligence Agent**
- Scrapes job postings from multiple platforms
- Identifies demand trends and skill clusters
- Powers the "Job Recommendations" section
- Computes match percentages (85%, 72%, 65%)

**3. Planner Agent**
- Computes skill gaps (Skills Met: 4, Skills Needed: 3)
- Generates learning roadmaps (9 weeks, 1 phase)
- Creates milestone timelines
- Powers the "Roadmap" section

**4. Action Agent**
- Executes job applications ("Apply Now" button)
- Tracks submission status and deadlines
- Monitors progress on learning tasks
- Reports completion to Profile Agent

**5. Failure Analysis Agent**
- Processes rejection feedback
- Classifies failure types (skill gap, timing, fit)
- Updates "Skills & Gaps" priorities
- Triggers roadmap adjustments

**6. Career Simulation Agent**
- Runs Monte Carlo simulations for career paths
- Predicts success probability and timelines
- Estimates salary ranges ($70K-$120K)
- Powers the "Career Paths" comparison view

**7. Reflection Agent**
- Compares predictions to actual outcomes
- Updates Career Momentum Score based on results
- Refines match percentages over time
- Adjusts risk levels in simulations

**Agent Orchestrator**
- Routes user actions to appropriate agents
- Coordinates multi-agent workflows
- Manages state synchronization across UI
- Ensures consistent data across all views

---

## Key Innovations

### 1. Career Momentum Score (CMS)
**Real-time progress indicator (0-100)** displayed prominently at 70/100.

```
CMS = w₁·SkillGrowth + w₂·OutcomeRate + w₃·Consistency

where:
SkillGrowth = skills_acquired / time_period
OutcomeRate = (interviews + offers) / applications
Consistency = 1 - variance(weekly_activity)
```

**Visual Feedback:**
- Green zone (70+): Healthy pace, good progress
- Yellow zone (40-69): Steady but could accelerate
- Red zone (<40): Stagnation, needs intervention

### 2. Failure-Aware Intelligence
When applications fail, the system:
1. Analyzes rejection reason
2. Updates skill gap priorities
3. Adjusts match percentages
4. Re-generates roadmap
5. Suggests alternative paths

**Example:** If rejected for "insufficient React experience":
- React moves to top priority in roadmap
- Match score for React-heavy roles decreases temporarily
- Alternative paths (Backend-focused) get higher visibility
- Learning timeline adjusts (+2-4 weeks)

### 3. Career Digital Twin
Simulates 3 alternative paths simultaneously:
- **Conservative**: Software Engineer (lower risk, proven path)
- **Balanced**: Full Stack Engineer (medium risk, broader skills)
- **Aggressive**: Frontend Architect (higher risk, premium compensation)

Each simulation includes:
- Timeline estimate (10 months)
- Risk assessment (Medium)
- Effort requirement (Moderate/Intensive)
- Salary range ($70K-$120K)

Users can switch paths and see updated:
- Skill requirements
- Learning roadmap
- Job recommendations
- Timeline projections

### 4. Dynamic Job Matching
Match percentages (85%, 72%, 65%) are computed using:
```
Match = (Skills_Overlap / Skills_Required) × Market_Fit × Timing_Score

where:
Skills_Overlap = intersection(your_skills, job_requirements)
Market_Fit = demand_level × competition_inverse
Timing_Score = readiness_factor × deadline_proximity
```

As you complete roadmap tasks:
- Match scores auto-update
- New jobs appear in recommendations
- Stretch roles become viable

**Career Simulation Agent ran 1000 simulations per path:**
- Path 1 success rate: 70% (if roadmap completed)
- Path 2 success rate: 65% (more skills = higher variance)
- Path 3 success rate: 55% (competitive, needs portfolio)

**User selects Path 2 (Full Stack Engineer):**
- Roadmap automatically updates
- New skills added: Node.js (Week 4-5), SQL (Week 6), AWS (Week 7-8)
- Job recommendations refresh to show Full Stack roles
- Timeline extends to 12 weeks

---

### Phase 6: Outcome Processing & Learning

**Scenario: User completes TypeScript milestone**

Profile Agent:
- Updates skill inventory: TypeScript (0.0 → 0.7)
- Increments CMS: 42 → 51 (+9 points)
- Marks milestone complete in Roadmap

Match scores auto-update:
- TechCorp role: 85% → 92% (TypeScript proficiency increased)
- New jobs appear requiring TypeScript

**Scenario: User gets rejected from TechCorp**

Failure Analysis Agent:
```
REJECTION ANALYSIS:
Company: TechCorp Inc.
Role: Frontend Developer
Feedback: "Strong technical skills, but limited production React experience"

ROOT CAUSE:
- Type: Experience Gap (not skill gap)
- Missing: Real-world React projects in portfolio
- Note: Technical interview went well

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add 2 production-grade React projects to portfolio
2. Contribute to open source React libraries
3. Highlight existing React work more prominently
4. Target roles emphasizing "junior-friendly" or "mentorship"
```

Reflection Agent updates strategy:
- Adjusts roadmap: Add "Build production React app" (Week 4-6)
- Lowers match threshold: Show 60%+ roles instead of 70%+
- Re-simulates paths with updated constraints
- Updates CMS formula weights (prioritize portfolio over courses)

**Dashboard reflects changes:**
- CMS: 51 (unchanged, rejection expected at current level)
- Roadmap: New milestone added
- Job Recommendations: More junior roles surface
- Burnout Risk: Checked (user maintaining healthy pace)

---

### Phase 7: Continuous Adaptation

**System operates autonomously:**

**Weekly:**
- Market Intelligence Agent scrapes new jobs
- Planner Agent adjusts priorities based on demand shifts
- Reflection Agent evaluates CMS trajectory

**Monthly:**
- Career Simulation Agent re-runs path predictions
- Profile Agent recalibrates skill proficiency based on usage
- Action Agent sends progress reports

**On Events:**
- Application submitted → Action Agent tracks
- Interview scheduled → Action Agent reminds + preps
- Offer received → Reflection Agent validates path prediction
- Rejection → Failure Analysis Agent extracts learning

**User sees:**
- CMS steadily increasing (51 → 58 → 64 → 70)
- Match scores improving across board
- Roadmap auto-adjusting to market changes
- Jobs getting easier to qualify for
