# NEXSTEP
### Autonomous AI Career Development System

> Career development as a closed-loop decision process, not static advice.

---

## Overview

NEXSTEP is a multi-agent AI system that treats career planning as **sequential decision-making under uncertainty**. Instead of providing one-time recommendations, it continuously reasons about career state, executes actions, learns from outcomes, and adapts strategy.

**Core Loop:**

---

## Problem Statement

Existing career platforms fail because they:
- Provide static advice that doesn't adapt
- Ignore rejection signals and failures
- Assume fixed career paths
- Lack measurable progress indicators

Students invest time without understanding *why* they fail or *what* to change.

---

## Solution

NEXSTEP models careers as evolving state systems where:
- **Rejections** = learning signals, not dead ends
- **Progress** = quantified via Career Momentum Score
- **Paths** = simulated before commitment
- **Strategy** = continuously updated from outcomes

---

---

## Key Innovations

### 1. Career Momentum Score (CMS)
**Real-time progress indicator (0-100)** displayed prominently at 70/100.

```
CMS = w₁·SkillGrowth + w₂·OutcomeRate + w₃·Consistency

where:
SkillGrowth = skills_acquired / time_period
OutcomeRate = (interviews + offers) / applications
Consistency = 1 - variance(weekly_activity)
```

**Visual Feedback:**
- Green zone (70+): Healthy pace, good progress
- Yellow zone (40-69): Steady but could accelerate
- Red zone (<40): Stagnation, needs intervention

### 2. Failure-Aware Intelligence
When applications fail, the system:
1. Analyzes rejection reason
2. Updates skill gap priorities
3. Adjusts match percentages
4. Re-generates roadmap
5. Suggests alternative paths

**Example:** If rejected for "insufficient React experience":
- React moves to top priority in roadmap
- Match score for React-heavy roles decreases temporarily
- Alternative paths (Backend-focused) get higher visibility
- Learning timeline adjusts (+2-4 weeks)

### 3. Career Digital Twin
Simulates 3 alternative paths simultaneously:
- **Conservative**: Software Engineer (lower risk, proven path)
- **Balanced**: Full Stack Engineer (medium risk, broader skills)
- **Aggressive**: Frontend Architect (higher risk, premium compensation)

Each simulation includes:
- Timeline estimate (10 months)
- Risk assessment (Medium)
- Effort requirement (Moderate/Intensive)
- Salary range ($70K-$120K)

Users can switch paths and see updated:
- Skill requirements
- Learning roadmap
- Job recommendations
- Timeline projections

### 4. Dynamic Job Matching
Match percentages (85%, 72%, 65%) are computed using:
```
Match = (Skills_Overlap / Skills_Required) × Market_Fit × Timing_Score

where:
Skills_Overlap = intersection(your_skills, job_requirements)
Market_Fit = demand_level × competition_inverse
Timing_Score = readiness_factor × deadline_proximity
```

As you complete roadmap tasks:
- Match scores auto-update
- New jobs appear in recommendations
- Stretch roles become viable

---

### Phase 6: Outcome Processing & Learning

**Scenario: User completes TypeScript milestone**

Profile Agent:
- Updates skill inventory: TypeScript (0.0 → 0.7)
- Increments CMS: 42 → 51 (+9 points)
- Marks milestone complete in Roadmap

Match scores auto-update:
- TechCorp role: 85% → 92% (TypeScript proficiency increased)
- New jobs appear requiring TypeScript

**Scenario: User gets rejected from TechCorp**

Failure Analysis Agent:
```
REJECTION ANALYSIS:
Company: TechCorp Inc.
Role: Frontend Developer
Feedback: "Strong technical skills, but limited production React experience"

ROOT CAUSE:
- Type: Experience Gap (not skill gap)
- Missing: Real-world React projects in portfolio
- Note: Technical interview went well

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add 2 production-grade React projects to portfolio
2. Contribute to open source React libraries
3. Highlight existing React work more prominently
4. Target roles emphasizing "junior-friendly" or "mentorship"
```

Reflection Agent updates strategy:
- Adjusts roadmap: Add "Build production React app" (Week 4-6)
- Lowers match threshold: Show 60%+ roles instead of 70%+
- Re-simulates paths with updated constraints
- Updates CMS formula weights (prioritize portfolio over courses)

**Dashboard reflects changes:**
- CMS: 51 (unchanged, rejection expected at current level)
- Roadmap: New milestone added
- Job Recommendations: More junior roles surface
- Burnout Risk: Checked (user maintaining healthy pace)

---

### Phase 7: Continuous Adaptation
